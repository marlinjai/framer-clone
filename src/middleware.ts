/**
 * The coarse edge auth gate for framer-clone.
 *
 * framer-clone owns NO identity. The only thing this gate knows about a user is
 * whether they carry a valid auth-brain session cookie. It is the OUTER fence:
 * "may this request touch the editor / authoring API at all". Fine, per-resource
 * authorization (workspace + action via OpenFGA) is the INNER check, run inside
 * each guarded route via `src/lib/auth-api.ts` -- defense in depth.
 *
 * Unauthenticated authoring traffic is bounced to the auth-brain login with a
 * `return_to` that brings the user back to exactly where they were. `return_to`
 * is the param the auth-brain login page reads; it open-redirect-validates the
 * value (must be a *.lumitra.co https URL or a same-origin path), so we build an
 * absolute URL from the forwarded host -- which is first-party in prod.
 *
 * Edge-runtime constraint: the middleware does NOT call `verifySession` here.
 * The auth-brain SDK client transitively pulls Node-only modules and would not
 * run in the edge middleware runtime, and a network verify on every edge hit is
 * the wrong place for it. The cookie PRESENCE check is the cheap gate; the
 * cryptographic verify happens server-side in the guarded route / server
 * component (`auth()` / `authenticateRequest`), which is the boundary that
 * actually reads protected data. A forged-but-present cookie gets past this gate
 * and is rejected by that verify -- it never reaches data.
